                <p class="tran-left">The PS Lab is ran by Mr. Roeth, an avid programmer who has been in the industry for 30 years.
                   He has experience in many programming languages such as Java (his favorite), C#. C++, COBOL,
                   python, Javascript, and plenty more. <br> Mr. Roeth is a dedicated teacher who spends the 
                   majority of his time preparing students to take their next step.

                <p class="tran-right">The Programming and Software Lab (PS Lab) is built to mimic an office environment.
                    It allows you to have your own area to work, without prohibitting a collaborative
                    environment.

        <div>
            <h1 class="tran-right">Community</h1>
            <p class="tran-right">The PS Lab is all about connectivity and learning together. Fellow peers are used often as a way to help
                eachother find out new things beyond what the lab teaches. If you want to explore something, you almost
                always can. <br> Projects in lab often have the option to be a partnered project, and whether you choose
                to or not, you will often find yourself collaborating with peers to find out how things work.
